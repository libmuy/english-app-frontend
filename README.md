# Libmuy English

Libmuy English is a Flutter-based (web platform only) application designed to help users learn English. This repository contains the frontend code for the application.

## The Idea

I have been learning English for many years, from middle school to now. I have tried and given up many times. Learning English is very hard for me, and I believe it is for you too. The idea for this app is inspired by the book `认知觉醒`. This book introduced me to the theory of the edge of the comfort zone and how the brain's structure can be changed to handle any information if you keep stimulating it with the information you want it to know.

This app is just a tool. The important points are:
- Recognize your future self-image of maintaining constant exercise.
- Keep constant exercise.
- Do the exercise at the edge of your comfort zone.

## Usage

- Translating Chinese to English
  - This will be an output exercise.
- Repeating to read the sentence
  - Repeat 10 times, for example, shadowing or just speaking.
  - Continue until you speak fluently.
- Review cycle
